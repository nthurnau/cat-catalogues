# cat-catalogues
A practice app that catalogues cats and their minions (people)


####New Addition: Gulp File
To practice, I decided to add some gulp.js automations. I used the following:
- gulp: initializes gulp and all of its fuctionalities when it's run in the terminal 
- gulp-util: allows testing of functionality
- gulp-concat: concatinates javascript and css files
- gulp-browser-sync: syncs changes in the files you're writing with the browser which reflects them in real time
- gulp-clean-css: takes css and minifies it - will also make a new minified css file and send it to the directory of your choosing
- gulp-nodemon: spins an express server for you
- gulp-sass: takes sass and interprets it into css, and then sends it to a directoty of your choosing.
- gulp-html-src: sources files (css or javascript) to your html file

#####Thoughts
Gulp really does make development processes easier! It automates many tasks for you!
